# Deep-Learning-Classification-On-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-With-CNN
Usage Of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) To Produce Deep Learning Models For MNIST Digits Classification

## Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

## About The Project
The project aims to make use of multiple Deep Learning techniques to create a Convolutional Neural Network to classify digits from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

This includes and is not limited to:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing & Wrangling
- Data Augmentation
- Model Architechture
- Model Visualisation
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Errors
